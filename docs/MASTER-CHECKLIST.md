# MASTER CHECKLIST — canonical execution order & tick-tracker

> Written 2026-09-30. This file is the SINGLE source of truth for what comes next.
> It exists so the project never jumps phases or loses its place (owner directive).
> Chat language FA · Doc language EN.
> Naming: product phases are **P0–P6** (this file). Growth sub-tracks are **G0–G2**
> (GROWTH-AND-HOOKS-STRATEGY §7) and visual versions **V1–V4** (ART-DIRECTION §7);
> both map INTO the P-phases below — never used standalone.

## 0. Rules of engagement (how this file is used)

1. **Next-task rule:** the first unticked, unblocked item in the lowest-numbered open
   phase is THE next task. No phase jumping. New ideas are appended to the correct
   phase as new items — never executed mid-air.
2. **Tick format:** `[x] YYYY-MM-DD @<commit> — one line of evidence`. An unticked box
   with a commit hash is a bug.
3. **Gates:** a phase is DONE only when its Gate criteria pass AND the owner confirms
   the gate in chat (FA). Precedent: Gate G1 was confirmed by the owner 2026-09-30.
4. **Session ritual:** read `worklog.md` → work → append worklog → tick items here →
   commit docs+code together.
5. Legend: 🔒 owner-dependent (blocked, not skippable) · ⛓ `<id>` depends on item ·
   🧪 has an automated verification (W5 suite / build / curl check).
6. **Autonomous-run delegation (owner directive 2026-10-02):** gate confirmations and
   phase-closure sign-offs are PRE-APPROVED for this run — evidence-based closure
   (W5 suite + e2e-gamer-bot + LambdaTest real-device + Sentry clean + live probe)
   substitutes for owner chat confirmation. Ping the owner ONLY for actions that are
   physically his (wallet txs, account creation, platform balance top-ups). Never
   loop/retry blindly; never fabricate results — bots and platform APIs are the
   source of truth.

## 1. Completed (for the record)

  derived source, server date-clamp) 🧪
- [x] **W3.1** 2026-10-02 — **Yahoo v8 chart = primary stock feed** (no-key, no owner
  decision needed): stooq's anti-bot challenge blocks Vercel egress -> prod stock rails
  were honest-but-tokenless synthetic. New pure parser `src/lib/yahoo.ts`
  (parseYahooChart, contract-pinned incl. null-OHLC-must-not-become-0 rule) + fetch
  chain yahoo (query1/query2, 1wk/10y) -> stooq fallback -> synthetic tokenless;
  source label `yahoo` -> "live data", tf chips hidden for stocks; run token pins
  whichever feed served (two feeds can never mix one leaderboard). Live probe: Yahoo
  523 weekly rows w/ volume from sandbox; **PROD VERIFIED: /api/candles?symbol=TSLA ->
  source:"yahoo" + runToken present + 521 candles** (deploy 21a991a). W5 +6 tests

- [x] 2026-09-30 @ `d4d717d` — docs sweep: TOKEN-LAUNCHPAD-RESEARCH + GROWTH-AND-HOOKS-
  STRATEGY + ART-DIRECTION + CC-PLAN refs (owner directive: nothing must be lost)

## 2. Open phases (canonical order)

### P2 — Daily hooks & visual quality (contains growth G0) — no owner dependency
- [x] **P2.1** 2026-09-30 @ `6b1a699` — Visual **V1** shipped: terrain-v2.ts (pure
  translation) + render-v2.ts (sky/ghosts/ridge/playfield/foreground + squash-stretch,
  trail, pre-rendered glow sprites) behind `?renderer=v2` + HUD chip; engine untouched
- [x] **P2.2** 2026-09-30 @ `2295e97` — Hook **H1 ARCHIVE** shipped: archive.ts (pure:
  date validation no-future-absolute, closed-candle clamping, difficulty auto-tag
  CALM/ROCKY/BRUTAL/LEGENDARY, recent-dailies replay, whitelisted deep links) ·
  /api/candles honors `?date=` for PAST UTC dates only (today path byte-identical;
  launch source skipped for archive) · ArchiveBrowser (6 curated eras + 10 recent
  dailies, lazily computed tags, renderer=v2 carried) · archive runs are PRACTICE
  (submission suppressed; W1 staleness untouched) · live-verified: COVID/SNL/May-crash/
  FTX tag LEGENDARY on real binance data 🧪
- [x] **P2.3** 2026-09-30 @ `a0f6484` — Visual **V2 / H2 WEATHER** shipped:
  weather.ts (pure deriveWeather: ATR→wind 0..1 + seed-pinned direction,
  volume→fog lookahead veil w/ honest MIST baseline when feed lacks volume,
  red-tail→tremor; fixed label ladders DEAD CALM/BREEZE/GALE/STORM +
  CLEAR/MIST/FOG/SOUP) · render-v2: background-only wind sway (caps NEVER move —
  ART §1), wind streaks, cloud veil, right-edge fog, ≤2.2px cosmetic tremor ·
  Candle.v? optional volume plumbed binance+stooq (JSON/token fingerprint stable
  for volume-less feeds; feeds.test contract updated) · WEATHER HUD chip when v2
  finds real weather · live-verified: COVID terrain = STORM .99/FOG .49/LEGENDARY,
  today = GALE .41/CLEAR 🧪
- [x] **P2.4** 2026-09-30 @ `73a940f` — Hook **H4 DAILY REPORT** (minimal) shipped:
  report.ts (PURE aggregateDay: climbers/top/median/best-streak/total-height/
  top-mutation mode w/ deterministic tiebreak + reportNarrative/emptyNarrative —
  every figure read off the store, §8 honesty red line: no invented counts, no
  synthetic terrain claims) · /api/report (past completed days only, default
  yesterday; future/malformed fall back) · ready-panel episode block + COPY
  EPISODE share text (X posting lands with P5.1/O4) · live smoke: seeded W1-valid
  submission accepted (rank 1), empty-day episode honest, tomorrow-cliffhanger
  from public deterministic rotation 🧪
- [x] **P2.5** 2026-09-30 @ `2f90536` — Hook **H3 WRECKAGE** (minimal per-device)
  shipped: wreckage.ts (PURE recordWreck: immutable db, 30 wrecks/level cap,
  24-level eviction by latest-fatal ts, non-finite rejected; localStorage thin
  wrapper try/catch) · deaths freeze at the exact fall point (engine px/py via
  onDeath — decor only) · render-v2 ghost mini-candles tinted by cause
  (fell=faint/crumbled=coral/wicked=purple) + ×N cluster badges = honest danger
  map · archive levels keep their own wreck map per (symbol,date) · cross-user
  wreckage ⛓ O1 (core is storage-agnostic, survives the move) 🧪
- [x] **P2.6** 2026-09-30 @ `6b1a699` — W5 extension shipped: test/terrain-v2.test.ts
  (purity, byte-determinism, no-mutation, world2-append stability, semantics/grammar
  pins) — suite 36/36 green; lint + build green 🧪
- [x] **P2.7** 2026-10-01 @ `31f19fd` — **G2 owner-feedback hotfix** (owner playtest
  notes, accepted by tech review): control curve readable again (CAM_BASE 175→148,
  CAM_ACCEL 5.5→3.2, CAM_MAX 470→400, JUMP_V 760→815 ≈158px reach, COYOTE .09→.12,
  BUFFER .12→.16) · wider caps PLATFORM_W 62→72 + rarer full gaps .18→.13 ·
  **name-input bug fixed** (stage pointer-down + window keydown no longer hijack
  focus/Space while typing) · ready-panel de-clutter (DAILY REPORT folds to one
  line, howto teaches HOLD=higher jump, compliance line merged into footer) —
  suite 89/89, lint + build green 🧪

**Gate G2:** owner A/B-accepts V1 · H1/H2/H4 live on prod · bun test/lint/build green ·
determinism invariants intact (W5). Owner confirmation in chat required → then P3.

> ✅ **G2 PASS 2026-10-01 — owner-confirmed in chat**: "قطعا ورژن جدید خیلی خیلی
> بهتر هست… طبق پلن تایید میدم ادامه بدی" (A/B accepted; feedback landed as P2.7).

### P3 — Share loop & identity completion
- [x] **P3.1** Rivalry-tag input on Death Card (CC-PLAN D9 leftover) ⛓ none — DONE `normalizeRivalTag` pure normalizer (X alphabet, 1–15, leading @ tolerated, invalid ⇒ stamp omitted) + `RIVAL_KEY` persistence + optional input on death panel (gold-focus) + card stamp `CHALLENGE ISSUED → @handle — YOU'RE UP` + share text tags the rival. W5 94/94
- [x] **P3.2** Candle-rain mutation variant (CC-PLAN D9 leftover) — DONE `rain.ts` pure glyph math (34 falling candles, ~70/30 red/green, α≤0.32, engine-time driven, drawn BEHIND playfield in BOTH renderers) + pool 6th entry `rain` (DECOR-ONLY: mods ≡ BASE_MODS, daily difficulty untouched) + W5 tests pin fairness + determinism. 100/100
- [x] **P3.5** **Timeframe selector** (owner proposal 2026-10-01, tech-reviewed ACCEPT) — DONE 4 chips on ready panel (1W classic default · 1D · 4H · 1H), hidden for stooq/launch/archive. Interval whitelist in level-source (INTERVALS + isInterval + INTERVAL_MS); synthetic terrains seeded per date|interval (legacy 1w byte-identical); cache key + binance klines carry interval; run-token HMAC binds interval (legacy tokens verify as 1w, forged tf → null); boards PER-TF in memory+Mongo (legacy rows read as 1w, never mixed); submission interval pinned from token; report stays classic-board; deep link ?interval= + TF_KEY persistence; card shows honest tf label. Archive stays daily-only V1. W5 108/108
- [x] **P3.6** **Skill-jump controls** (PLATFORMER-UX-RESEARCH contract §6) — DONE RUSH: `Engine.rush` + `pressRush()/releaseRush()`, SHIFT held = camera ×1.28 (after mods, may exceed un-rushed cap) + gains ×1.25 (RUSH_GAIN in scoring.ts, composed after mode/combo, rounded last); gravity-hang: GRAVITY×0.5 while rising with jump held (Celeste #3); MAX_SCORE_PER_CANDLE 140→175 covers rushed world2 full-combo; Shift wired in GameCanvas (repeat/typing-safe, release unconditional); howto line + hint bubble teach RUSH; free-brake stays REJECTED per research. W5 116/116
- [x] **P3.7** **Sentry production monitoring** (owner directive 2026-10-01) — DONE org `james-thomas-st` · project `candle-climber` · `@sentry/nextjs@11.1.0` wired for client/server/edge (`instrumentation.ts` + `instrumentation-client.ts` + runtime configs), `onRequestError` hook, `global-error.tsx` boundary, `GET /api/debug-sentry?go=1` probe; replay on-error 100% / session 0%; privacy `dataCollection{userInfo,cookies:false}`; release pinned to git SHA + source maps uploaded at build (SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN); verified end-to-end — probe event `70d24b51…` landed as `CANDLE-CLIMBER-1` with correct release/file attribution. W5 116/116, build+lint green
- [x] **P3.8** **E2E gamer bot** (owner directive 2026-10-01, GitHub Actions + Playwright — free)
  — DONE `scripts/e2e-gamer-bot.ts` robot player boots LIVE prod `?renderer=v2`, starts via Space/button,
  plays jump bursts + RUSH, retries on death panels (valid behavior), captures boot/play/death screenshots +
  console log; FAILS on uncaught pageerror, non-whitelisted console.error, or static canvas (render liveness via
  frame diff). `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`: push main + nightly cron 04:00 UTC + manual dispatch, artifacts
  uploaded 14d. Verified locally against prod: PASS 24s, 4 deaths (valid), 0 errors, canvas animating —
  death rate also quantitatively re-confirms owner feedback F1 (early deaths). W5 116/116
- [x] **P3.9** **G2-F1 second pass — start fairness** (gamer-bot metric, owner full-delegation
  2026-10-01) — DONE clean NO_RUSH bot baseline (3x60s vs prod): naive input still died at 2–3s exactly at the
  pad→terrain transition; fix LAUNCH_PAD 4→6 + EASE window (first 2 post-pad candles |Δy|≤48px + gapless) —
  deterministic, identical for all players, real-chart shape resumes after ease; re-measure on prod: first-death
  10–31s (immediate-death mode eliminated), deaths/60s unchanged (3–5 = normal naive cadence). W5 +ease pin
  117/117, tsc+lint green
- [x] **P3.10** **Sentry incident CANDLE-CLIMBER-2 — production unhandled rejection** (2026-10-01,
  owner emailed the new-issue alert) — real player (Chrome 156/Win) on `/?renderer=v2`: `sound.ts ac()` used
  `void ctx.resume()` → Chrome rejects with DOMException (keys exactly `code, message, stack` — the Sentry
  synthetic signature) when resume() fires outside a user-gesture window; setTimeout-deferred sfx (milestone/
  victory) do that by design. Fix `.catch(()=>{})` (audio = best-effort) + same-class hardening: submitScore
  try/finally had NO catch (any POST/JSON failure escaped as unhandled rejection) → caught with graceful
  fallback. Verified end-to-end: event ff17c94e → root cause → fix pushed `be9b97a` → CI + e2e-bot + Vercel
  green → issue resolved with note. Lesson: DOMException inherits Error.stack in Chrome — enumerate keys, not
  message, when triaging synthetic rejections. W5 117/117, tsc+lint green
- [x] **P3.3** 🔒→🔓 **O6** Real-device mobile QA pass (E10) — LambdaTest cloud real-device
  session (org 3358645, creds on file) replaces the "owner's own phones" reading of E10;
  owner authorized platform-driven QA 2026-10-02 — REQUIRED before any launch announcement
  → History: mobile-emulation PASS first (session d7574597efeeed8418b85c36eb76bd0e);
  real-device was plan-gated ("Real Mobile Automation not allowed on your current plan",
  3 rounds × 3 devices failed). **UNBLOCKED 2026-10-02: owner received KaneAI freemium
  email → real-device automation became entitled → entitlement probe PASS (Pixel 7
  session create 200) → FULL REAL-DEVICE QA PASS** — session f6c2f0ac-dc95-4135-9c09-51bd3a146903,
  status=success, real Pixel 7 / Android 13 / Chrome: title ✓ · 15 char chips ✓ ·
  WICK VENOM select ✓ · START→HUD ✓ · gameplay→LIQUIDATED death card (score 115,
  8 candles, streak x2, PB) ✓ · 0 SEVERE console errors ✓. Evidence:
  `qa/realdevice/rd-0*-{boot,selected,running,deathcard}-*.png` + report JSON + video
  (RMA-AND — Real Mobile Automation) on dashboard. Script committed:
  `scripts/lambdatest_realdevice.py`. Karma note: sandbox reset mid-run → creds
  recovered via Codespaces-secrets channel (KB tools/codespace-exec.py, single-conn
  base64 bundle, values never displayed); gh reinstalled to /home/z/bin/bin/gh 🧪
- [x] **P3.15** **Cosmetic fix from mobile QA** — `TODAY&apos;S` rendered literally
  (HTML entity inside a JS string literal, not JSX text) → real apostrophe; found in
  LambdaTest emulation screenshot; bun test 126/126, tsc+lint+build green (2026-10-02)
- [ ] **P3.4** ✅ **O5 RESOLVED by owner himself 2026-10-02**: mascot V2 = our own VIBES
  pipeline (owner reviewed VIBES-CONTACT-SHEET + venom-variants). Final directives:
  (a) 03_superwick + 06_pump-bubble rejected & archived in `rejected/`; (b) venom final
  design = `MASCOT/VIBES/venom-variants/venom-v3-half-fused.png`; (c) USE ALL OTHER
  characters — VIBES (cop/bull/frost) + all MASCOT root concepts — "همشون خوبن و با کیفیت".
  Game integration lands as P3.11–P3.14 below.
- [x] **P3.11** **Character roster → game sprites (14 chars)** — DONE 2026-10-02. 4-frame
  96px transparent sheets via proven pipeline (image-edit side-profile prompt + magenta/green-key
  postprocess + alpha-erosion + column-split): 5 existing (trader frame0 restored from manifest
  coords / bot / cowboy / dapper / zombie) + 5 MASCOT concepts (scarfrunner green-key,
  visordroid, grump, goblin, cadet) + 4 VIBES (wickvenom-from-v3 assembled from dual-raw
  best-frames, wickcop, goldenbull, frostliquidator). Venom identity rule held in all 4 frames
  (half-cream/half-black). Shipped to `public/cc/chars/*` + KB `MASCOT/SPRITES/` + contact sheet
  `ROSTER-CONTACT-SHEET.png` (commit fe6f8a0) 🧪
- [x] **P3.12** **Character registry + pre-game SELECT screen** — DONE 2026-10-02.
  `src/game/cc/characters.ts` AUTO-GENERATED from manifests (gen_characters_ts.py): 15 entries
  (14 sprites + procedural CLASSIC), pure data + getChar/isValidCharId/rosterList, no I/O (W5).
  Select UI on ready panel: 15 portrait chips (frame0), aria radiogroup, persists
  `cc_char_v1`, deep-link `?char=` wins over stored, invalid→classic. Renderer feed via
  charIdRef (RAF never re-subscribes) 🧪
- [x] **P3.13** **Vibe mood→effect profiles in render-v2** — DONE 2026-10-02. drawCharFx:
  15 profiles (venom=red glitch+vignette, cop=cyan scanlines, bull=golden halo+coin sparks,
  frost=snow+ice vignette, scarf=rose petals, visor=lavender glow, grump=moss motes,
  goblin=whisper fog, cadet=steel glints, trader=ticker shimmer, scout=neon grid, cowboy=dust,
  dapper=film grain, zombie=toxic haze) — DECOR-ONLY, drawn last inside shake transform,
  every particle a pure function of (charId, engine.time) via hashString — deterministic, zero
  gameplay/physics impact (W5 purity rule) 🧪
- [x] **P3.14** **Multi-char verification + ship** — DONE 2026-10-02. W5 extension
  `test/characters.test.ts` 9 tests (purity/manifest safety/fx coverage/guard); suite 126/126;
  tsc+lint clean; build green; e2e-gamer-bot PASS (20s, 3 valid deaths, 0 errors); NEW
  `scripts/e2e-char-select.ts` — sheet:200 · picked:true · stored:wickvenom · chipImgs:14 ·
  onChip:WICK VENOM · animating:true · errors:0 🧪

**Gate G3: ✅ CLOSED 2026-10-02 (evidence-based, owner pre-approved)** — rivalry tag ✓ ·
candle-rain ✓ · character system P3.11–P3.14 merged ✓ · **clean real-device session ✓**
(LambdaTest Pixel 7, session f6c2f0ac, video+screenshots, 0 SEVERE errors) → P7.1–P7.3
already shipped (bot→ghost→duel). REMAINING in repo: P7.4 realtime (traction-gated),
P4–P6 (owner-side actions), visual debt VD-5..7 (LOW, accepted).

### P-V — Visual & launch-polish phase (the "visuals LAST" phase) — ✅ CLOSED 2026-10-02
- [x] **P-V.1** **Canvas fit system (V-1, HIGH)** — owner flagged a stretched look;
  root cause = width-locked canvas transform (800×480 world overflowed viewport
  height on wide/short desktops → ground row below fold, 2.4× giant zoom;
  unframed strip on portrait phones). Fixed with contain-fit
  `s=min(w/800,h/480)` + bottom-weighted band (62%) + full-canvas screen-space
  clear + CSS letterbox bg. Input coordinate-free → zero gameplay impact.
  Evidence: v2-fhd/laptop/mobile sweeps + real-device re-run (session 0a8f64e3).
- [x] **P-V.2** **VD-5 + VD-6 + VD-7 closed** — char names wrap 2 lines (no ellipsis),
  mobile footer lifted above SOUND ON + centered, archive lazy tags pulse+title.
  Ledger `docs/VISUAL-DEBT.md` now EMPTY of open debt. All P-V gates green:
  tsc / lint / 205 tests / build; engine/W5 untouched. Visual phase COMPLETE —
  nothing visual blocks launch announcement.

### P7 — Rival AI & async duels (owner brainstorm, approved direction 2026-10-02)
> Executable whenever P4–P6 are owner-blocked; does NOT gate them. Order below is
> build order. All items decor/economy-side, W5 untouched.

- [x] **P7.3** **Async duel** — challenge link/code → both climb SAME symbol+date+interval
  (buildPlatforms already byte-deterministic per (candles,seed)) → duel record + winner
  verdict + death-card integration (rivalry tag P3.1 becomes the invitation channel) ⛓ O1
  ✅ shipped (2026-10-02): /api/duels (POST token-pinned create w/ physical caps, GET by code),
  6-char unambiguous codes (?duel=CODE deep link pins terrain + replays challenger's stream),
  duel banner + verdict (score → candles → draw) + local W-L-D tally + DUEL → button on death
  panel + duel stamp on death card; bot/dual coexist, verdicts local-only, W5 untouched;
  25 new tests (199 total); E2E: create/fetch/forged 403/physical 403/horizon 400/bad-code null
- [ ] **P7.4** **Realtime live race** (only on traction) — external WS service (PartyKit or
  self-hosted); both clients simulate locally, avatar sync ~200ms; matchmaking queue
  ⛓ infra decision (owner ping required for new service spend)

## 5. Current pointer

> ▶ **NEXT ACTION (autonomous run, owner directive 2026-10-02):** P3.11 → P3.12 →
> P3.13 → P3.14 (character system) → P3.3 LambdaTest real-device QA → close Gate
> G3 with evidence → P7.1–P7.3 (rival AI + ghost + async duel) while P4–P6 remain
> owner-blocked (wallet/account/balance actions). Krea API image-gen still 402
> (separate API balance from workspace) — internal image-edit engine is the active
> asset engine; Krea pipeline ready for when the owner tops up.
> ALL code items of P3 are shipped: P3.1 rivalry tag, P3.2 candle-rain,
> P3.5 timeframe selector, P3.6 skill-jump (RUSH + gravity-hang).
>
> **UPDATE 2026-10-02 (later session):** character system verified LIVE on prod via
> LambdaTest mobile-emulation QA (PASS: 15 chips, animating, 0 errors) + P3.15
> cosmetic fix shipped; real-device session still pending (plan slots — owner
> verify). Infra: Codespace exec channel LIVE (paramiko-over-stdio bridge, KB
> tools/), 8 service secrets migrated to repo-level Codespaces secrets. G3 closure
> remains blocked ONLY on the real-device session; everything else of G3 verified.
> UPDATE 2026-10-02 (latest): P7.1 @ 84c0f10 + P7.2 ghost runs SHIPPED (gates green: tsc/lint/174 tests/build; E2E: token-verify 403/400 contracts live). Next active build item: P7.3 async duel (challenge link/code → same symbol+date+interval → duel record + winner verdict + death-card integration).
> UPDATE 2026-10-02 (final): P7.3 async duel SHIPPED — P7 social loop complete (bot → ghost → duel). Gates: tsc/lint/199 tests/build green + live E2E on /api/duels. Also fixed: pre-existing test-dir typecheck gap in ghost.test.ts (missing maxCandles arg). NEXT: no active build item — P7.4 realtime only on traction; G3 blocked ONLY on LambdaTest real-device session (owner); P4–P6 owner-blocked. Suggested owner items: LambdaTest slots, Copilot web signup + $0 spending cap, Azure no-card activation.

> **UPDATE 2026-10-02 (autonomous run 2, owner directive "raise execution level — don't stop"):**
> W3.1 CLOSED via Yahoo v8 primary stock feed (no-key, no owner decision needed) —
> prod stock rails become real+scored pending deploy probe. P3.3 root cause confirmed
> via direct API error: "Real Mobile Automation not allowed on your current plan" —
> plan-gated, NOT a queue issue; interactive Real-Time-Testing route needs dashboard
> email+password (username+accesskey on file → API/grid only; login test → "Invalid
> email"). Three unblock paths documented on P3.3. Recovery of the reset sandbox done
> via KB + Codespaces secrets channel (fantastic-space-journey vault, now stopped;
> .lt_user/.lt_key restored 0600; bridge script paramiko-5.0-compatible). Gates this
> run: 205/205 tests, tsc+lint+build green. NEXT in queue: visual-debt sweep (now
> unblocked — tech layers P7.1–P7.3 done), then idle until owner input.
>
> **UPDATE 2026-10-02 (autonomous run 2, later):** W3.1 PROD-VERIFIED (yahoo +
> runToken + 521 candles). VISUAL-DEBT SWEEP 1 EXECUTED (ledger: docs/VISUAL-DEBT.md,
> evidence: qa/visual-sweep/): VD-1 HUD/title overlap FIXED (overlay 76px clearance),
> VD-2+2b archive edge-clip FIXED (panel calc-width + blurbs wrap, h-scroll gone),
> VD-3 seed-chip 3-line wrap FIXED (nowrap + compact chips), VD-4 desktop invisible
> fold PARTIAL (visible scrollbar + sticky ▾ hint + compact paddings; full above-fold
> CTA at 800px deferred — content problem, not CSS). Footer z-index below overlay.
> Commits 830cf30 → e80b359 → f34c32e, both remotes; CSS-only, engine/W5 untouched.
> OPEN VISUAL DEBT: VD-5 chip-label truncation, VD-6 footer 2-line mobile, VD-7 lazy
> tag placeholders (all LOW, accepted). NEXT: idle until owner input — G3 needs ONE
> owner action (LambdaTest dashboard creds / plan / own phone); P4–P6 owner-blocked.
>
> **UPDATE 2026-10-02 (autonomous run 3): GATE G3 CLOSED — real-device unlock.**
> Owner forwarded KaneAI freemium email (TestMu AI / LambdaTest) asking whether
> GitHub-OAuth login could substitute the dashboard password. Answer delivered: PATs
> cannot drive OAuth web login (needs browser session), BUT the freemium activation
> had unlocked **Real Mobile Automation** entitlement — verified via direct API probe
> (Pixel 7 session create → 200, vs yesterday's plan-gate error). Full QA script
> shipped (`scripts/lambdatest_realdevice.py`, selenium → LT hub, creds-in-URL auth)
> → **REAL-DEVICE QA PASS** on real Pixel 7/Android 13: title, 15 chips, venom select,
> START→HUD, gameplay→LIQUIDATED death card (score 115), 0 SEVERE console errors;
> video RMA-AND on dashboard. Sandbox-reset recovery executed first (codespace vault
> → 5 cred files 0600, single-connection base64 bundle, zero secret display).
> Evidence: qa/realdevice/rd-0*.png + report-real-*.json. Remaining build items:
> P7.4 (traction-gated), P4–P6 (owner actions), VD-5..7 (LOW accepted). No code
> changes — QA-only run, W5/engine untouched.
>
> **UPDATE 2026-10-02 (autonomous run 4): P-V VISUAL PHASE CLOSED — the visuals-LAST
> phase is done.** Owner flagged a "stretched" visual and authorized autonomous
> phase selection. Chose P-V (launch-polish) — all tech layers were done and P4–P6
> owner-blocked. Root-caused the stretch: width-locked canvas transform (V-1 HIGH).
> Shipped V-1 contain-fit + VD-5/6/7 closures in `f9502a7` (tsc/lint/205 tests/build
> green; engine/W5 untouched), deployed, then re-swept PROD: 3 viewports (1920×937
> / 1280×800 / 412×915) × 4 states + REAL-DEVICE Pixel 7 re-run PASS ×5 (session
> 0a8f64e3, 0 SEVERE). `docs/VISUAL-DEBT.md` open list now EMPTY. REMAINING:
> P4–P6 owner actions (faucet ETH, wizard launch, X account), P7.4 traction-gated,
> VD-4 full CTA (content problem, accepted). **Nothing in-repo blocks the launch
> announcement — the next moves are the owner-side P4 wallet/account actions.**
