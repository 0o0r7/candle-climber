## 0. TL;DR decisions for Candle Climber

| Phase | Tool | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| p1 (now) | **MongoDB Atlas** | Claim $50 credits → `DATABASE_URL` | Leaderboard persistence; $50 on M0 free-tier usage lasts years |
| p1 (now) | **Vercel Hobby** | Deploy via browser OAuth | Free (not part of Pack — unchanged plan) |
| p1 (now) | **GitHub Copilot Student** | Enable on owner account | Unlimited completions — free dev velocity for the whole build |
| p2 | **Namecheap** | Claim 1yr `.me` + 1yr SSL | Game domain (e.g. candleclimb.me) |
| p2 | **Sentry** | Activate student Team plan | 50K errors/100K transactions/500 replays — production error tracking |
| p2 | **BrowserStack** | Activate Automate Mobile | Real iOS/Android testing of the canvas game + touch controls |
| p2 | **SimpleAnalytics** | Claim 1yr Starter | Privacy-friendly, 100k views/mo — growth loop measurement |
| p3 | **Heroku** | Claim $13/mo × 24 mo | **Replaces DigitalOcean (removed from Pack)** — hosts the duel/match WebSocket server |
| p3 (opt) | **Blockchair** | 100K free API requests | Multi-chain market data experiments (chain-data side quests) |
| anytime | **1Password / Termius / GitLens** | Claim | Secrets hygiene + SSH + Git QoL for the owner |

**Skip (rationale):** Clerk (wallet auth = Reown, no email auth needed), Datadog + New Relic
(Sentry covers it — avoid observability sprawl), Stripe $25 (payouts are onchain, no card flow),
Camber GPU (no ML workload), Azure $100 (nothing needs it; Vercel+Atlas cover us; revisit if we
ever need containers/VMs for game servers), .TECH/Name.com (Namecheap covers domain), feature
flags (ConfigCat/DevCycle — overkill until live-ops at scale; mutations are seed-driven already).

Arduino/Adafruit (hardware fun) · GitHub Foundations Certification prep ✅ (resume value).

### Notable REMOVALS / absences (vs common outdated knowledge)
- **DigitalOcean $200 credits — GONE.** Old plans citing DO must switch to Heroku credits.
- **Supabase — not currently in the Pack.**
- SendGrid/Travis CI/Atom-era tools long gone; CI = GitHub Actions (free 2,000 min/mo on Free, more as Pro).

## 2. Reusable playbook (future projects — the real deliverable)

Rule of thumb: **claim in this order, always.**
1. **Identity & safety first:** 1Password → rotate any token ever pasted in chat → enable 2FA everywhere.
2. **Dev velocity:** GitHub Pro + Copilot Student + JetBrains (if IDE person) + Codespaces hours.
3. **Pick ONE deploy host** by workload: static/Next.js → Vercel Hobby (free, not Pack) ·
   long-running server (WebSocket/game/cron) → Heroku credits · need VM/container → Azure $100.
4. **Pick ONE database** by shape: document/leaderboards → MongoDB Atlas $50 · relational+auth
   → Supabase free tier (independent of Pack) · nothing → don't add one.
5. **Observability = Sentry, full stop.** Add Datadog/NR only when a specific need Sentry can't meet appears.
6. **Domain at p2, not p1** (renames are free before you print it anywhere): Namecheap `.me` or Name.com.
7. **Mobile/web QA before launch:** BrowserStack Automate Mobile (canvas games especially).
8. **Growth measurement from day one of beta:** SimpleAnalytics (privacy-friendly = no cookie banner).
9. **Learning budget is a Pack feature:** FrontendMasters/Boot.dev = compounding returns; schedule it.
10. **Skip anything with a monthly-maintenance cost after credits run out** — a student project
    should die of natural causes, not of a credit card charge.

### Project archetypes → stack cheatsheet
| Archetype | Host | DB | Extra |
|---|---|---|---|
| Landing/docs | GitHub Pages / Vercel | — | — |
| Web app (Next.js) | Vercel Hobby | Atlas M0 | Sentry, SimpleAnalytics |
| Game with realtime | Vercel + Heroku (WS server) | Atlas / Redis-on-Heroku | BrowserStack, ConfigCat |
| Data/ML | Deepnote / Camber GPU | Atlas | Azure credit |
| SaaS w/ billing | Vercel | Atlas + Clerk Pro | Stripe credits |

## 3. Credential checklist (owner actions, in order)

- [x] GitHub PAT (already in use — **rotate after build phase**, store in 1Password)
- [ ] Enable **Copilot Student** (education.github.com → Copilot)
- [ ] p1: Vercel deploy via browser login (no token needed)
- [ ] p1: MongoDB Atlas M0 → create cluster → `DATABASE_URL` → paste to Vercel env + `.env.local`
- [ ] p2: Namecheap `.me` claim → DNS → Vercel
- [x] p2: Sentry — DONE 2026-10-01 (org `james-thomas-st`, project `candle-climber`, SDK wired, event verified; see §4 below)
- [ ] p2: BrowserStack + SimpleAnalytics claims
- [ ] p3: Heroku credit claim → duel server app
- [ ] anytime: 1Password student plan

Nothing beyond this list is needed for the current build.

## 4. Sentry production monitoring (wired 2026-10-01)

Owner created the Sentry account + admin token (`sntryu_…`); I did the rest end-to-end.

- **Org** `james-thomas-st` (region us) · **Project** `candle-climber` (`javascript-nextjs`,
  created via API) · DSN public: `https://059663a5fc68fe45cbcf425ebaaea26e@o4512112704028672.ingest.us.sentry.io/4512177773608960`
- **SDK** `@sentry/nextjs@11.1.0` — init split by runtime:
  `src/instrumentation.ts` (node/edge register + `onRequestError`),
  `src/instrumentation-client.ts` (client init + `onRouterTransitionStart`),
  `src/sentry.{server,edge}.config.ts`. `next.config.ts` wrapped with
  `withSentryConfig` from `@sentry/nextjs/config` (v11 moved it out of the root export).
- **Sampling**: traces 10% · Session Replay **on-error 100% / session 0%** (canvas is not
  recorded; DOM UI is) · privacy: `dataCollection: { userInfo: false, cookies: false }`.
- **Boundaries**: `src/app/global-error.tsx` reports render-fatal errors (SUMMIT LOST UI).
- **Probe**: `GET /api/debug-sentry` (hint) / `?go=1` (sends one info event, returns
  `event_id`) — works on every deploy for instant pipeline checks.
- **Build wiring**: `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in local `.env` → build creates a release pinned
  to the git SHA and uploads source maps (verified: "Successfully uploaded source maps").
  On Vercel the token must be added as env var **O7** or source-map upload is skipped
  (build still passes; error reporting itself does NOT need the token).
- **O7 CLOSED (2026-10-01)**: owner-supplied Vercel API token → added `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`
  (secret) + `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` to all targets via API → redeployed.
- **Source-map root-cause chain (commit `c8b8301`)**: (1) `withSentryConfig` had no
  explicit `release` → plugin resolved the release name inconsistently across
  environments; (2) `silent: true` swallowed all plugin diagnostics; (3) **Next 16 /
  Turbopack emits ZERO client `.map` files by default** (verified: 0 maps in
  `.next/static` vs 57 in `.next/server`) so client stack traces stayed minified.
  Fix in `next.config.ts`: `release: { name: SENTRY_RELEASE || VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA ||
  git rev-parse HEAD }`, `productionBrowserSourceMaps: true`, `silent: false`,
  `debug: SENTRY_DEBUG==='1'`. Note: v11 CLI uploads via **artifact bundles**
  (`artifactbundle/assemble`), so `/releases/{sha}/files/` returning 0 is EXPECTED —
  verify by event symbolication, not the files endpoint.
- **Verified end-to-end (twice)**: probe event `70d24b51…` (local, release `603edca…`)
  and probe event from PROD on release `c8b8301c…` → issue `CANDLE-CLIMBER-1`,
  symbolicated frame `src/app/api/debug-sentry/route.ts`, release attribution exact.
- **Secrets**: auth token lives only in gitignored `.env` (never commit; rotate if leaked).
- **TODO (UI-only, API refused)**: DSN key hardening — allowedDomains + rate limit under
  Project → Settings → Client Keys (2 minutes, non-blocking).

## 5. ENV VAR MANIFEST — names only, for coding agents (added 2026-10-06)

> **Agent rule:** read NAMES from this table + `.env.example`; read VALUES only from
> `process.env`. A missing/empty value means the feature stays flag-off — never
> simulate, never hardcode, and **never paste secret values into any chat**.
> Values live in exactly two places: local `.env.local` (git-ignored) and the Vercel
> dashboard. GitHub Actions (if ever needed) → repo/environment Secrets.

| Var name | Service (GitHub Student Pack origin) | Purpose | Owner sets it in |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` (`MONGODB_URI` alias) | MongoDB Atlas ($50 credits) | Leaderboard persistence (memory fallback if absent) | `.env.local` + Vercel |

| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` | WalletConnect Cloud free tier | E2 wallet layer (flag-off until then) | `.env.local` + Vercel |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROBINHOOD_RPC_URL` | public testnet RPC (no key) | P4.2 Balance Gate reads | Vercel (after E2) |
| `WICK_TOKEN_ADDRESS` | — (public on-chain value) | $WICK `0xE2cE…216c` (launch #5963) — committed in `.env.example` | — |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_ENABLED` | — (flag) | Wallet layer inert when absent | Vercel (after E2 QA) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_GATE` | — (flag) | Coming-soon shell ON when `on` | Vercel |
| `ACCESS_KEYS` | — (generated) | Comma-separated tester keys; empty = gate fails OPEN | `.env.local` + Vercel |
| `ACCESS_KEY_SECRET` | — (generated) | HMAC secret for signed tester cookie | `.env.local` + Vercel |
| `VERCEL_ENV` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV` | Vercel platform | Runtime environment detection | auto — no action |
