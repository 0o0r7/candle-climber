# FEEDS — every data feed Candle Climber consumes

> Written by task 30-a (workstream W3). The ecosystem knowledge base requires that
> **every feed a product consumes is documented** — URL, interval, cost/licensing,
> determinism rule and failure mode (KB §9 req 3, carried into this repo's
> ecosystem docs: `docs/ECOSYSTEM_BAR.md`, "reconstruct the expectation factors"
> per CC-PLAN §1–2 / GAME_DESIGN §8–9). This page is that registry. When a feed is
> added, moved or re-keyed, update this file in the same commit.

## The determinism doctrine (applies to every feed)

- A level is pinned to a **UTC date**. The same date must yield a **byte-identical**
  response — any player, any client, any time that day (and its token stays valid
  through the following day, `src/lib/run-token.ts`).
- Therefore **only CLOSED candles shape terrain**. The in-progress candle/week is
  dropped at fetch time; open time of the next period is the cutoff.
- Every non-synthetic terrain is **server-vouched**: the response carries an HMAC
  `runToken` (payload = symbol+date+candle count+sha256 of the exact candle JSON).
  Synthetic fallback terrain is tokenless → runs on it are **unscored**.
- Server caches are keyed `` `${symbol}|${date}` `` (vibe-launch adds a `vibe:` +
  launchId prefix) with a 24h TTL; the cached entry stores the **source** so a
  cached synthetic never masquerades as live.

## Source labels in the UI (honesty rules)

| seed.source   | label        | scored? | data character                          |
|---------------|--------------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| `binance`     | "live data"  | yes     | real Binance weekly OHLC                |
| `yahoo`       | "live data"  | yes     | real Yahoo Finance weekly OHLC (stocks, primary) |
| `stooq`       | "live data"  | yes     | real stooq weekly OHLC (stocks, fallback)|
| `vibe-launch` | "vibe launch"| yes     | **DERIVED** terrain from real launch metrics — never labeled "live" |
| `robinhood`   | "official on-chain price" | yes | **DERIVED** shape anchored to the REAL official Chainlink price on Robinhood Chain — never labeled "live" |
| `synthetic`   | "synthetic"  | no      | deterministic seeded fallback (tokenless)|

## 1. Binance klines — crypto daily levels

- **URL**: `https://api.binance.com/api/v3/klines?symbol=<SYM>&interval=1w&limit=220`,
  fallback host `https://data-api.binance.vision` (same path; official public
  market-data mirror that tolerates datacenter egress IPs).
- **Symbols**: `WATCHLIST` rotation (BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT, DOGEUSDT, XRPUSDT,
  BNBUSDT) or a deep link `/?symbol=<SYM>` honored when whitelisted.
- **Interval / shape**: 1w klines, array rows, index 6 = closeTime (ms).
- **Cost / license**: free, keyless, public market data (Binance terms apply).
- **Determinism**: drop rows with `closeTime > now` (only closed weekly candles);
  24h cache keyed symbol|UTC-date.
- **Failure mode**: geo-block HTTP 451 on the primary host (known for US-hosted
  serverless) → try the `.vision` mirror → still failing → **synthetic tokenless
  fallback** (source "synthetic", unscored). Client also has a full offline
  synthetic path in `GameCanvas` when the API itself is unreachable.

## 2. Yahoo Finance v8 chart — stock rails, PRIMARY (W3.1)

- **URL**: `https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/<SYM>?interval=1wk&range=10y`
  (fallback host `https://query2.finance.yahoo.com`, same path) — e.g.
  `.../chart/TSLA?interval=1wk&range=10y` ≈ 520 weekly rows.
- **Why (W3.1 closure)**: stooq's anti-bot challenge **blocks Vercel's egress
  IPs**, so from prod every stock rail degraded to honest-but-tokenless
  synthetic. Yahoo's keyless v8 endpoint serves serverless egress without a
  challenge → stocks are REAL, scored terrain from prod. Stooq stays as the
  fallback feed; the run token pins whichever candles served, so the two
  feeds can never mix within one leaderboard (W1 invariant).
- **Format**: JSON — `chart.result[0].timestamp[]` (unix SECONDS, week start)
  + `chart.result[0].indicators.quote[0].{open,high,low,close,volume}[]`.
  Parsed by **pure** `parseYahooChart` in `src/lib/yahoo.ts` (contract pinned
  by `test/feeds.test.ts`; no new dependencies).
- **Mapping**: `Candle.t = timestamp * 1000`; o/h/l/c per arrays; volume kept
  when finite > 0 (feeds H2 weather fog). Rows with null/non-finite OHLC are
  skipped (Yahoo emits nulls for halt/holiday stubs).
- **Cost / license**: free, keyless, public chart endpoint (Yahoo ToS apply;
  one symbol per UTC day + 24h cache = negligible load).
- **Determinism**: a weekly row closes **7 days after its week-start stamp**;
  rows whose close time is still in the future (the in-progress week) are
  dropped — same closed-candles-only rule as every other path.
- **Failure mode**: non-OK HTTP, JSON without a usable `chart.result[0]`
  (rate-limit/error shapes), <40 closed rows, or network error → **stooq
  fallback** → still failing → **synthetic tokenless fallback** (unscored).
- **Source label**: `yahoo` → "live data" (real OHLC); timeframe chips hidden
  (stocks are weekly-only rails).

## 3. Stooq weekly CSV — stock rails, FALLBACK (W3)

- **URL**: `https://stooq.com/q/d/l/?s=<lowercase>.us&i=w` — e.g.
  `https://stooq.com/q/d/l/?s=tsla.us&i=w`. Weekly rows, one per week.
- **Format**: CSV, header `Date,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume`, then one row per
  week. Parsed with plain string splitting (`route.ts` `fetchStooq`) — **no new
  dependencies**.
- **Mapping**: `Candle.t = Date.parse(rowDate + "T00:00:00Z")`; o/h/l/c are the
  row's numbers.
- **Cost / license**: free, keyless, zero cost. Public CSV download endpoint of
  stooq (personal/low-volume use; we fetch one symbol once per UTC day and cache
  24h — negligible load).
- **Determinism**: a weekly row closes **7 days after its date**; rows whose close
  time is still in the future (the in-progress week) are dropped — same
  closed-candles-only rule as the crypto path. Cache keyed `TSLA|<date>` etc.
- **Failure mode (observed 2026-09-30 from the dev sandbox)**: stooq fronts the
  CSV endpoint with a JavaScript proof-of-work anti-bot challenge for some
  datacenter IPs, and **hard-denies others even after the challenge is solved**
  (HTTP 200 body "Access denied" with a solved `auth` cookie). Residential/EU
  consumer egress IPs typically get the CSV directly. Any non-CSV payload,
  challenge page, <40 closed rows, or network error → **synthetic tokenless
  fallback** (unscored, staleness marked by construction). The whitelist still
  accepts the symbol so deep links keep working through a degraded day.
- **Source label**: `stooq` → "live data" (real OHLC).

## 4. vibe/vibe launches — launch-of-the-day (derived secondary source)

- **URL**: `https://testnet.vibevibe.fun/api/v1/chains/46630/v6/launches?limit=5`
  (cursor API, max limit=5 — sufficient for launch-of-the-day). Real payload
  shape captured in `research-cache/launches_ALL.json` (top level
  `apiVersion/requestId/data{items,page}/meta`; items carry `launchId`, `name`,
  `symbol`, `createdAt`, `graduated`, `curve{...}`, `market{holderCount,
  volume24hPairUnits, buyCount24h, sellCount24h, priceChange*Bps, ...}`).
- **Wiring**: `GET /api/candles?source=launch` (the only whitelisted source
  value; the client passes `/?source=launch` through). The launch ticker becomes
  the level symbol — sanitized: uppercase, non-alphanumerics stripped, max 10
  chars, fallback `VIBELAUNCH`.
- **Cost / license**: free, keyless, platform's own public testnet API
  (chain 46630 = Robinhood Chain testnet). One request/hour max thanks to cache.
- **Caching & the day pin**: the raw response is cached **1h keyed by the UTC
  hour bucket**; the launch-of-the-day resolution is then **pinned per UTC date**
  (`sha256(utcDate) mod items.length` over the API's newest-5 list). The pin is
  what keeps "same date → byte-identical response" true even though the newest-5
  membership drifts during a day. Caveat (documented): the pin lives in memory,
  so a server restart mid-day re-resolves from the current top-5 — the terrain
  stays internally consistent (one launch per response + token), but may differ
  from a pre-restart response for the same date. First success of the day wins.
- **Derived-terrain mapping** (`src/lib/vibe-launch.ts` `vibeLaunchCandles` —
  same text in code comments; deterministic in (launch, date) only, never
  `Date.now()`):
  - `count = clamp(60, 60 + floor(ageDays at level date), 219)` — the launch's
    **real age** shapes level length.
  - `vol24 = Number(volume24hPairUnits)/1e18`; `volScore = clamp01(log10(1+vol24)/6)`
    — real 24h pair volume scales volatility.
  - `holdScore = clamp01(log2(1+holderCount)/8)` — real holder count calms the
    path (`noise = 0.06 − 0.03·holdScore`).
  - `dirBias = clamp(-1, (buyCount24h − sellCount24h)/(buys+sells), 1)` — real
    24h buy/sell flow sets drift direction; `baseDrift = dirBias·(0.004 +
    0.02·volScore)·(graduated ? 1.5 : 1)`.
  - Micro-structure (wicks, regime shifts every ~20 candles) from
    `mulberry32(hashString("cc-vibe-v1:" + launchId + ":" + date))`. Prices are
    abstract units anchored at 100 — the real metrics shape character, they are
    not fake OHLC.
  - `priceChange*Bps` fields are ignored: frequently `null` in the captured
    payload; buy/sell counts are always present.
- **Honesty**: `seed.source = "vibe-launch"`, `seed.interval = "derived"`, UI
  label "vibe launch". This is **derived** data — it must never be presented as
  live prices of the token.
- **Failure mode**: fetch error, non-OK status, or no valid items → the daily
  **synthetic tokenless path** (same rule as every feed failure).

## 5. Robinhood Chain on-chain price — official stock anchor (W6)

- **What it is**: the ONLY official, machine-readable stock price on Robinhood
  Chain — the per-ticker Chainlink `AggregatorV3Interface` feed, read straight
  from the public MAINNET JSON-RPC (chain **4663**). No key, no vendor, no
  dependency. Module `src/lib/robinhood-chain.ts`; standalone read
  `GET /api/onchain/quote?symbol=TSLA`.
- **Address source**: the Chainlink reference-data directory
  `https://reference-data-directory.vercel.app/feeds-robinhood-mainnet.json`
  (6h cache) is the primary resolver, per the docs' rule to read addresses from
  the directory rather than hardcoding them. A 2026-10-07 verified snapshot
  (`VERIFIED_STOCK_FEEDS`) is the offline/test fallback. Both are recorded with
  raw evidence in `docs/ROBINHOOD-CHAIN-INTEGRATION.md`.
- **Read**: `eth_call` → `latestRoundData()` + `decimals()` (never assumed). The
  answer is already multiplier-adjusted (ERC-8056), so what is read IS the token
  price — the multiplier is never applied twice.
- **Validation (the honesty gate)**: chain must be 4663, answer > 0, round
  complete (`updatedAt > 0`), not future-dated, within `MAX_QUOTE_AGE_SEC` (7d —
  stock feeds publish 24/5 and legitimately HOLD their last value through
  weekends/holidays, so a long market closure must not read as a dead feed). A
  failed gate yields `null` — never a zero or silently stale price.
- **Wiring**: stocks only, and TODAY's level only — an archive `?date=` chart is a
  PAST terrain, so today's price is not comparable and is deliberately skipped.
  The quote is attached as `seed.onchain`; the served terrain's final close is
  compared against it (`deltaPct`) and `verified` requires fresh **and**
  |deltaPct| ≤ 10%. The terrain is never silently rescaled to match a price.
- **Anchored terrain** (`seed.source = "robinhood"`): when no OHLC feed can serve
  the stock (Yahoo 429 / stooq anti-bot), the deterministic shape is rescaled so
  its final close EQUALS the official price. Shape derived, anchor official —
  labeled `OFFICIAL PRICE · <sym>`, **never** "live data". Server-vouched
  (`runToken`), so it scores, exactly like the other derived source.
- **Network split (important)**: the production Chainlink feeds exist on MAINNET
  only. The testnet faucet Stock Tokens (chain 46630) are REAL ERC-20s but a
  DIFFERENT contract set with MOCK feeds — used for identity only, never priced.
- **Cost / license**: free, keyless, public JSON-RPC — one directory fetch
  (6h cached) plus two `eth_call`s per stock level per UTC day (24h response
  cache).
- **Failure mode**: feed unknown (e.g. NFLX has no published feed), RPC error, or
  failed validation → `seed.onchain` absent and `official: null`. The existing
  feed chain is unchanged, and synthetic stays explicitly synthetic + tokenless.
- **Re-verify (repeatable)**: `bun scripts/verify-feeds.ts` walks reachability →
  every published official feed → testnet identity → two negative controls, and
  exits 0 (verified) / 1 (feed failure while the chain is up) / 2 (network
  unreachable) so a transport problem is never reported as a bad feed. Last
  captured run + its evidence: `docs/ROBINHOOD-CHAIN-INTEGRATION.md` §7.

## 6. Synthetic fallback (not a feed, but part of every failure path)

- **Source**: `src/game/cc/level-source.ts` `syntheticCandles(date, LIMIT)` —
  `mulberry32(hashString("cc-daily-v1:" + date))` over the daily seed; identical
  client- and server-side, so the game stays playable with the API down.
- **Determinism**: pure function of the UTC date.
- **Cost**: none, no network.
- **Failure-mode role**: tokenless (no `runToken`) → runs on it are **unscored**
  client-side (`GameCanvas` submit gating) and would be rejected server-side
  (403). Staleness/outrage is thus always marked honestly.
